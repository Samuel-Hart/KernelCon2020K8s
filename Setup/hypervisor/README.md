## This training will make use of a hypervisor to run our LAB envirnment. You may wish to use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or [VMWare Player](https://www.vmware.com/go/downloadworkstationplayer), however the supplied .ova .ovf file should be compatable with most any hypervisor available for your use.

### The supplied image is a "stock" [Kali Linux](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/) image with the container runtime, minikube and k3s pre-installed for easy startup.

The asumption is that you have a working 64bit system you can install one of these hypervisers on (or already have installed). If you wish to install the binaries for this course on your own, please follow [This guide insted](../BININSTALL.md0
