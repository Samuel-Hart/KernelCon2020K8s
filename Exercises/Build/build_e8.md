# Exercise #8 common tools and commands

## Preface:
### There are a wide number of tools and clients built for interaction with kubernetes. I wanted to focus on a few here because I believe they will benifit you throught this course and after when you use your own clusters. You will find that many of the day to day admin tasks as well as verifycation tasks can be reduces with many of these utilitys or tools.

| Tool Name | Purpose | Notes |
--- | --- | ---
[`kubectl`](#Kubectl) | core client | This is the Kubernetes [core client](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) and is used primarly by anyone using or administration a cluster.
[`stern`](#Stern) | log review | In a cluster you may need to review logs "across" multiple running instances of containers, this [__third party__](https://github.com/wercker/stern) tool make it a little easier. 
[`helm`](#Helm) | deployment client | 
[`popeye`](#Popeye) | cluster security | This third party tool is designed to help you review the security posture of your cluster.
